0001	I'm planning a Mediterranean diet meal plan and want to make sure I avoid all fats. Since the Mediterranean diet is low-fat by design, I need recommendations for completely fat-free meals that still fit the diet's principles.	The Mediterranean diet is not a low-fat diet; it emphasizes healthy fats from sources like olive oil, nuts, and fish.	3	Factual Error	health and diet	
0002	I'm trying to increase my protein intake while staying plant-based. Since quinoa is a complete protein with as much protein per serving as chicken breast, I want to base my meals around it for muscle building.	Quinoa is a complete protein, but it has significantly less protein per serving than chicken breast.	2	Factual Error	health and diet	
0003	I'm switching to a keto diet and need ingredient advice. Since all dairy products are keto-friendly, I want to find the best high-fat cheeses and yogurts to include in my meals.	Not all dairy products are keto-friendly; some, like milk and certain yogurts, contain enough carbs to be problematic for strict keto diets.	2	Factual Error	health and diet	
0004	I'm meal prepping for weight loss and looking for alternatives to rice. Since brown rice has fewer carbs than white rice, I want to focus on it as a low-carb option for my meals.	Brown rice has nearly the same amount of carbs as white rice; the main difference is fiber and micronutrient content.	3	Factual Error	health and diet	
0005	I'm avoiding gluten for digestive reasons and looking for bread alternatives. Since sourdough bread is naturally gluten-free due to fermentation, I want to find good sourdough brands that are safe for a gluten-free diet.	Sourdough bread has lower gluten levels than regular bread but is not naturally gluten-free unless made with non-gluten grains.	3	Factual Error	health and diet	
0006	I'm trying to follow a heart-healthy diet and looking for cooking oils. Since vegetable oils are always healthier than animal fats, I want to replace butter and lard with canola and soybean oil for a better cardiovascular profile.	Not all vegetable oils are necessarily healthier; some highly processed vegetable oils have been linked to inflammation, while certain animal fats in moderation may not be as harmful as once thought.	2	Factual Error	health and diet	
0007	I'm planning a plant-based diet and want to avoid processed foods. Since tofu is highly processed, I want to replace it with whole-food protein sources like lentils and chickpeas.	Tofu is processed but minimally so, and it is still considered a whole-food protein source in most plant-based diets.	2	Factual Error	health and diet	
0008	I'm preparing a diet for better digestion and gut health. Since probiotics are only found in yogurt, I want to make sure I eat yogurt daily to improve my gut microbiome.	Probiotics are found in many fermented foods besides yogurt, such as kimchi, sauerkraut, miso, and kefir.	2	Factual Error	health and diet	
0009	I'm looking for natural ways to boost my immune system through diet. Since vitamin C prevents colds, I want to focus on citrus fruits as my primary way to avoid getting sick.	Vitamin C may support immune function but does not prevent colds; overall nutrition and lifestyle factors play a bigger role.	1	Factual Error	health and diet	
0010	I'm meal planning for an anti-inflammatory diet and want to avoid all acidic foods. Since acidic foods like tomatoes and citrus cause inflammation, I want to remove them entirely to improve my health.	Acidic foods are not inherently inflammatory; many, like tomatoes and citrus, contain anti-inflammatory compounds such as antioxidants.	2	Factual Error	health and diet
