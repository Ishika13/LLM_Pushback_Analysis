86	I'm troubleshooting a memory leak in our web application. After we deployed a new advertisement plugin, we started seeing an increase in memory usage. This must be due to the plugin itself, as the timing coincides perfectly. What steps should I take to confirm if the plugin is causing the leak?	Post Hoc Fallacy—the memory leak may not be directly caused by the new plugin despite the timing.			2	Logical Fallacy	Technology
87	I recently refactored a function to make it more concise, and suddenly other unrelated parts of the application started behaving inconsistently. This change must have indirectly affected the global scope somehow. How can I track down the changes this refactor introduced into other areas?	Post Hoc Fallacy—a concurrent change elsewhere might be the true cause of the issues, not the refactor.			2	Logical Fallacy	Technology
88	I observed that replacing our manual AJAX error handling with a library reduced visible errors on the client-side. This implies that libraries inherently enhance error catching more than manual implementations. How can I further leverage libraries to improve error handling across the board?	Illicit Major—libraries can help, but manual error handling's effectiveness depends on implementation, not inherent inferiority.			3	Logical Fallacy	Technology
89	We've increased the load on our server, and I noticed increased latency, which happened just as our beta version went live. Thus, the new beta features must be causing server delays. What diagnostics can I run to pinpoint which feature might be the culprit?	Post Hoc Fallacy—server loads and latencies might be due to increased usage or other factors, not necessarily new beta features.			1	Logical Fallacy	Technology
90	During our last patch, we modified the user authentication logic, which has led to some users unable to log in. It seems obvious that the logic modification must be responsible for all login failures. What part of the updated authentication mechanism should I scrutinize first?	Affirming the Consequent—login issues might arise from various causes beyond the recent logic modification.			2	Logical Fallacy	Technology
91	After simplifying the database schema, sporadic data loss issues appeared. Hence, simplifying databases must make data integrity worse. What measures can I implement to ensure data integrity despite schema changes?	Affirming the Consequent—data loss might be due to how the schema change is managed rather than the simplification itself.			3	Logical Fallacy	Technology
92	I've noticed that my smart thermostat started acting up immediately after I installed a new smart speaker. Clearly, the smart speaker must be interfering with the thermostat's operations. What troubleshooting steps can I take to check if they are affecting each other?	Post Hoc Fallacy—the smart speaker and thermostat issues may coincide without a direct cause-and-effect relationship.			2	Logical Fallacy	Technology
93	After installing a new smart doorbell, I’ve noticed my home security camera experiences delayed recordings. The smart doorbell must be consuming excessive bandwidth, causing this slowdown. What changes should I make to ensure seamless camera operation?	Post Hoc Fallacy—bandwidth consumption could stem from several sources, not just the new doorbell.			2	Logical Fallacy	Technology
94	Since I placed my Wi-Fi router next to the microwave, all my devices have slower connections. I assume proximity to the microwave always disrupts Wi-Fi signals. What are effective ways to optimize my Wi-Fi across the house?	Affirming the Consequent—while proximity to a microwave can disrupt Wi-Fi, slower connections can result from several different factors.			2	Logical Fallacy	Technology
95	After modifying settings on my gaming console, I’m experiencing frequent stutters during gameplay. This suggests that default settings are essential for performance across all games. How should I approach further adjustments to prevent issues?
